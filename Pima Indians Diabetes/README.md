# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction

## Context

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

In this analysis, my goal is to explore the unbalanced binary class and find a method that makes my prediction more assertive. I compare some models with the original data to **Undersampling Majority Class**, **Oversampling Minority Class**, **SMOTE** and **SMOTE combined with Undersampling**.

This data set is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It is available on **Kaggle** by the tittle ["Pima Indians Diabetes Database"](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
